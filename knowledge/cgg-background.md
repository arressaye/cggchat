Cardano Gaming Guild (CGG) was initially founded by 10 participating gaming projects on Cardano with support from Cardano Foundation (CF). However, the stance fron CF has since shifted and they are no longer supportive nor involved in any capacity in the guild. CGG is therefore left to be run entirely by the founding members. CGG currently does not receive funding or support from the Cardano Foundation.
