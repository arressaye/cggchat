What is CryptoRaggies?
    Introducing CryptoRaggies, an innovative NFT project on the Cardano blockchain that celebrates Ragdoll cats and the diverse crypto community. Our handcrafted, one-of-a-kind NFTs feature actual coat colors and patterns of Ragdoll cats, complete with vibrant backgrounds and accessories. As passionate blockchain enthusiasts, we seamlessly integrate Cardano and crypto culture into our artwork.

    We're not just about stunning visuals—our Raggies have utility too! Play our first game, RaggieRun, on PC, iOS, and Android, the pioneering wallet-enabled game on Cardano and the first CNFT game on Google Play and the iOS App Store.

    CryptoRaggies aims to create a harmonious ecosystem, exploring NFT technology beyond art and constantly adding value to the project. Join us as we build the decentralized future of NFTs and celebrate the love for Ragdoll cats!

Is CryptoRaggies an art project, a gaming project, a PFP project, or a utility project?
    We would say we are a mixture of all! At the very core, we are a utility project. We believe in web 3 technology and we believe in Cardano, in particular. We want to create a project that can harness the power of web 3 technology offered by the Cardano blockchain and showcase to everyone what can be built on it. Therefore we have built a game, a wallet, a marketplace, and a full working ecosystem of tech and services supporting a sustainable circular token economy. All to demonstrate the possibilities brought about by Cardano! So, yes, while we are very proud of our art work, which is one-of-a-kind on the entire blockchain, we are more inclined to be known as strong and consistent builders delivering above and beyond what our users expect.

What are the products built by CryptoRaggies?
    1. RaggieRun
        RaggieRun is the first ever wallet-connected, NFT-enabled game on the Cardano blockchain. It is a side-scrolling infinite runner game in which players play as their own Raggie NFT to collect toys, coins and use superpowers to score as high as they can. The game has been live since October 2021, and is currently the only Cardano NFT-enabled game on all major platforms including web, Android and iOS!
    
    2. RaggiePurrse
        RaggiePurrse is a Cardano light wallet built specifically for the CryptoRaggies ecosystem. Instead of building it as a browser plugin, RaggiePurrse runs as a standalone progressive web app and communicates with apps via a websocket connection. This means that, while none of the existing Cardano wallets can communicate with a native mobile app, RaggiePurrse can do it with ease. This innovation has allowed us to build a complete ecosystem with asset management, NFT staking, NFT trading via marketplace and auction house, NFT gaming via RaggieRun, and much more - all available to all Ragsters to use regardless of the device they are on!

    3. RagAlley
        RagAlley is a smart contract marketplace using Plutus V2 smart contracts to handle all listings and auctions. It is an on-chain marketplace and auction house created by the CryptoRaggies team, aimed at being a community marketplace for communities. RagAlley accepts non-ADA tokens as currency by default, and sellers can list their items for any of the supported currencies which include $RAG, $DERP, $DJED, $iUSD, $MCOS and many more! Projects are welcome to approach the team to get their collections and tokens verified for listing or use on RagAlley, so as to leverage our platform to run community auctions to engage their communities!

    4. RaggieCoin ($RAG)
        RaggieCoin is the official ecosystem token of CryptoRaggies. Specific tokenomics are as follows:
            Ticker: RAG (Registered on Cardano Token Registry)
            Policy: ca942cb8bb5d1ef750766ded355f320880539111f10efa2b1a478ff9
            Supply: 100,000,000 (100 Million)

            Distribution:
            65% - Ringfenced to be supplied to liquidity pools when available on Cardano. At present, 40% of the total supply has already been supplied to SundaeSwap to establish an initial $RAG/ADA liquidity pool.
            20% - Set aside in a 2-year vesting schedule to support our innovative NFT Staking platform with gradually declining reward multipliers.
            15% - Kept in dev wallet for now, to be transferred to a multi-sig wallet after LP established.

            Purpose of 15% liquidity (15 million RAG) in dev wallet:

                i. Fortnightly airdrops to Plush Toy NFT holders
                        a. Amount to be airdropped will be proportional to the number of CryptoRaggies minted by time of snapshot. Each airdrop will be capped at 100 RAG per unique wallet address holding a Plush Toy NFT. Cap will be increased to 200 RAG per unique wallet address holding a Hydra or Ape Plush Toy NFT. The actual amount airdropped will be in proportion to the percentage of CryptoRaggies minted. So if 1000 CryptoRaggies have been minted, this will unlock 10% of the airdrop cap and regular Plush Toy NFT holders will receive 10 RAG, while Hydra and Ape holders will receive 20 RAG.
                        b. This mechanism will lead to a maximum drop of 24,000 RAG every 2 weeks. If the liquidity in the dev wallet were to be used solely for airdrops to Plush Toy NFT holders, this will sustain a minimum of 24 years.

                ii. Support for in-game rewards
                        a. Players of our casual games earn in-game points which can be used to redeem RaggieCoins. This will be done via a web portal at the early stage, but we aim to implement a smart contract to handle this in the future.
                        b. We estimate this will be a significant expenditure for the dev wallet, possibly outsizing the amount spent on airdrops to Plush Toy NFT holders as this involves every CryptoRaggies NFT holder who plays our casual games.

                iii. Ad-hoc community giveaways and contests
                        a. We will run giveaway events and contests to raise awareness of RaggieCoin and our ecosystem. This will be a minor part of the total expenditure

                iv. Combining the above, it is estimated that the liquidity within the dev wallet will cover running expenses for the next 5 years at the minimum
            
            Utility:
                RaggieCoins will be used in every aspect of our project ecosystem.

                At the very first stage, RaggieCoins will be implemented in our Game Shop (RaggieStore) to purchase in-game upgrades for Raggies. These purchases will also require a small amount of ADA to cover dust fees and NFT minting costs.

                RaggieCoins can also be used in the Raggie Rehoming Centre to "rehome" Raggies acquired by the project through our innovative rehoming programme.

                Holding RaggieCoins will also unlock premium features in our on-chain auction house RagAlley, such as the ability to place bids at higher or even custom increment levels!

                Additionally, holding RaggieCoins will be a core requirement for any project approaching us for services, such as minting and marketplace building.

                When our breeding system is implemented, RaggieCoins will be required to apply for a breeder’s licence, and every breeding transaction thereafter will require RaggieCoins. It shall be noted at this point, that applying for a breeder's licence will require a large amount of RaggieCoins (by today's standards at least) and holding multiple (at least FIVE) Raggies.

                In the final phase of the evolution of our project, many of our game, breeding and payout parameters will be decided by community. RaggieCoins, at that point, will also function as a governance token to decide an individual’s voting power

                Finally, $RAG has an active yield farm on both Minswap and Wingriders, and holders can supply liquidity to either or both DEXes and participate in yield farming, earning more $RAG and ADA in the process!

    5. RaggieStore
        RaggieStore is one of the first project-specific marketplaces on Cardano to utilise multi-signature transactions to mint in-game add-ons for players. Through RaggieStore, we have also become one of the first projects on Cardano to actively use NFTs as in-game assets beyond the player's own avatar. For example, it is possible to mint superpower add-ons from RaggieStore for RaggieRun. These add-ons typically come with a 24 hour validity period, after which they will no longer work in the game. These NFTs can then be burnt in RaggieShrine for entry into a raffle to win even more prizes! In a nutshell, RaggieStore powers the backbone of our RaggieCoin economy and also enhances gameplay for all our players.

    6. RaggieShrine
        RaggieShrine is where players can burn their expired RaggieRun in-game add-on NFTs by "making an offering to Blaze the Raggie Almighty". By doing so, they permanently burn their expired token and, in return, they gain an entry into a raffle per NFT burnt. The raffle has a list of attractive prizes, including RaggieRun superpower add-ons with extended validity up to 14 days!

    7. Raggie Rehoming Centre
        The Raggie Rehoming Centre forms the cornerstone of our circular economy. Much of our project utilities generat both $RAG and ADA income for the project, and a significant amount of ADA income comes from dust fee that goes with every $RAG transaction. We accumulate all the dust fee and use it to buy Raggies off the secondary market at "floor price", and list them at the Rehoming Centre for our community to "rehome" using $RAG, at a cost equivalent to just under the current floor price. This is made possible because $RAG is listed on CoinGecko, and we can use the CoinGecko API to get the live exchange rate between $RAG and ADA.

Why are there two policy IDs for CryptoRaggies NFTs?
    There are two policies for Raggies because the collection did not finish minting by the time the original policy got locked. This is because the collection contains a total of 10,000 NFTs, and when we launched the project, we did not manage to gain the momentum to fully mint out the whole collection. The original policy locked before we could finish minting the collection, resulting in only 2,000 Raggies being minted under the first policy. It was decided that we should continue minting the remaining NFTs under a new policy, as Raggies are essentially access tokens into a full gaming ecosystem, limiting the supply to 2,000 is equivalent to limiting our maximum number of full users, which was seen as a poor strategy. Therefore a new policy was created and the remaining 8,000 Raggies were minted under this new policy. Although there are 2 policies for Raggies, all 10,000 Raggies are treated equally within our ecosystem. There is no difference between the two policies and they are seen as the same collection.

Can Raggies be staked?
    Yes! In fact we are one of the first projects on Cardano to implement a non-custodial staking system in which your NFTs do not need to leave your wallet to be staked! Our staking system is also unique in that we do not believe in "staking for the sake of staking". We have a staking programme that has a defined purpose - to enable the Free-to-Play system for RaggieRun and all our subsequent games. As Raggies also act as in-game avatars, or game accounts, holding a Raggie is essential to interact with our games. However we also want to enable non-Raggie holders to play and enjoy our ecosystem without any upfront investment. Hence we have created a Free-to-Play mechanism via staking. Raggie holders can stake their Raggies using our proprietary non-custodial staking system, and by doing so, they make their Raggies available to be picked by non-Raggie holders to use in order to play our games. In exchange, Raggie stakers earn a constant background rate of $RAG based on our 2-year vesting schedule, and whenever a Raggie is picked by a Free-to-Play player, 10% of their in-game score will be transferred to the staker's account in the form of XP. This XP can then be converted to $RAG using our web portal. In this way, we use a staking system to reward our holders, and to allow non-holders to participate in our ecosystem and generate value and rewards for all participants!
