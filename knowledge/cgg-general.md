This is a summary of a meeting within Cardano Gaming Guild (CGG)
The purpose of this meeting was to establish the mission statement, vision, and objectives of the guild.
CGG does not have a specific individual founder, but was founded collectively by 10 founding member projects.
The founding members of the CGG include:
    1. BattleBorgz
    2. Cardano Warriors
    3. CryptoRaggies
    4. Danketsu (Formerly known as ADA Ninjaz)
    5. Eden's Seven
    6. Equine
    7. Mocossi
    8. SuperBull
    9. Wolves of Rome
    10. X-Race


Summary of meeting:
The proposed mission statements for the CGG are as follows:


    1. To be a centre of resource & education
        - Knowledge sharing and education of Cardano basics, technology updates, development codes, including sharing best practices.
Provide a platform for resource sharing and to promote innovation in blockchain gaming development
Community building

    2. A marketplace for everyone to discuss and build rapport amongst various sub groups
        - Be a community hub for Gamers and Developers to interact

    3. Advocacy
        - To promote Cardano as a trusted blockchain for Web3 gaming, and to demystify the ADAverse
        - To advocate Cardano ecosystem for mainstream adoption for Web3 gaming


In particular, each project involved have the following contributions:

X-RACE:
    What I see the guilds main objectives to be:
        1. A resource for gaming projects to collaborate, share knowledge and build the whole space up together. Some way to make development easier for those who want to try to do it. Right now for a bigger game developer Cardano is a tough place to start building if they were looking to get into blockchain game development. We can help lessen that transition and create some content or at least a centralised place to ask questions to people that have done it or are doing it. That would be very beneficial for the entire blockchain.

        2. A central information hub for the Cardano gaming community a place for news and discussion.
        A place where projects can feature their own game and let gamers pick their favourite based on information from various sources: the game publishers can create themselves a introduction, or users can find what’s trending, read user reviews, sort games by genre
        If possible, a community hub is also essential, see this example from Splinterlands: https://www.splintertalk.io/ 
        Trying to bring traditional gamers into blockchain gaming and advocating for Cardano at least as a starting point.
        Also advocating for  gamers and crypto enthusiasts from other blockchains.
        On this I have read a lot of forum posts relating to NFTs in games just in the GDevelop community forums where I am currently building out our arcade games and one of the key things raised regularly are environmental concerns around NFTs. Cardano is a good low impact chain this could be a focus of this education (not all chains are the same) 
        Second this - The benefits of Cardano, particularly on the environmental side should be promoted.
        People often view it as money grabbing by builders and don’t see it as a value add. Most view it as a new more expensive difficult to use version of microtransactions
        Becoming an online-offline advocate in web3 gaming, through multiple forums.
        Education around the benefits NFTs can bring to traditional gamers and why they shouldn’t fear them.
        Explain real game asset ownership
        Talk about ecosystems being able to be built around a single NFT rather than needing a bunch of games 
        Explaining why it is very different to microtransactions and it all comes down to NFT integration within the game compared to the NFT technology itself being the issue.
        Using an example of in-game skins should be a key selling point on this front imo.
        I think as a guild that represents the chain and the industry in general education not only to those within the space already but those outside looking in would be a good idea.

    What we should not be:
        We should as much as we can avoid gatekeeping
        We are not an investment guild we should not be an alpha service for others we should not tell people to invest in any particular project over another
        We will not financially support other projects either.
        We are not a DAO like a lot of other gaming guilds we do not purchase NFTs that can be used by others to earn or offer scholarships for example.
        Should not regulate or police excessively on ideations or discussions

======================

CryptoRaggies:
    Vision:
        Make web3 gaming accessible to all

    Mission:
        To provide a platform for developers to share resources (for most devs)
        To promote innovation in blockchain gaming development (for skilled devs)
        To cultivate a learning environment for new developers (targeting very new devs)
        To encourage mainstream adoption of web3 gaming (for all - devs and gamers) 



Wolves of Rome:
    To facilitate collaborative efforts between projects solving problems in the space - if an active problem does have a solution tech wise by a member - the connecting of member via the guild can save valuable time & resources simply by communicating and collaborating. E.g. Wolves of rome may be working toward solving a problem for appstore with an NFT game and raggies have already solves said problem. Or ADA Ninjas could be running an event and need collaborative partners to be part of the activation/prizes. The guild acts as a great way to facilitate these interactions - we should know each others projects well so we can refer well.

    Collective efforts to bring increased visibility to Cardano. We need to show the world we have more than one game. One cool product but present a collective united front to build a reputation of great gaming on the Cardano blockchain. This can only be achieved collectively. A single project is not an indicator of mass building and is unlikely to cut through the noise and the FUD. 

    To create an attractive builders community for creators and game developers to help them settle on their blockchain of choice when making the leap to web 3. This could come in all forms, marketing support, advice, resources etc.


Rogue Galaxies (Game made by NMKR):
    Possible Goals:
        Trustworthy source of quality content and games in the Cardano Space (Does not mean that every game outside of the CGG does not meet this requirement but we should ensure that we have a quality standard that people can expect)
        Internal support of projects within the CGG with knowledge exchange, problem solving, collaborations and resource management (Agreeing with Wolves of Rome mentioned points)
        Collaborative Effort to increase visibility of the Cardano Gaming Space. E.g. instead of 5 projects visiting an event with small booth spaces, funnel resources together and create one big booth for higher visibility.

    Possible No-Gos:
        Being too inclusive, which will bloat the GCC and make it harder to have an overview and meet given quality criterias.


Danketsu:
    Key focuses:
        Education
        Collaboration
        Partnerships
        Support in understanding the space 
        Onboarding outsiders
